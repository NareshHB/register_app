## Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y

# Download Jenkins GPG key
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

# Add Jenkins repository to package manager sources
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
```

Save this script in a file, for example, `install_jenkins.sh`, and make it executable using:

```bash
chmod +x install_jenkins.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using:

```bash
./install_jenkins.sh
```

This script will automate the installation process of OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless and Jenkins.

***Install Jenkins plugins:** 

Maven, SonarQube Scanner, Docker Pipeline, Kubernetes CLI.

**Configure Jenkins with credentials for GitHub, Docker, SonarQube, and Kubernetes**

## Steps to create a private Git repository, generate a personal access token, connect to the repository, and push code to it:

1. **Create a Private Git Repository**:
   - Go to your preferred Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
   - Log in to your account or sign up if you don't have one.
   - Create a new repository and set it as private.

2. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Navigate to your account settings or profile settings.
   - Look for the "Developer settings" or "Personal access tokens" section.
   - Generate a new token, providing it with the necessary permissions (e.g., repo access).

3. **Clone the Repository Locally**:
   - Open Git Bash or your terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository's URL. For example:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_URL>
     ```
   Replace `<repository_URL>` with the URL of your private repository.

4. **Add Your Source Code Files**:
   - Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
   - Paste your source code files or create new ones inside this directory.

5. **Stage and Commit Changes**:
   - Use the `git add` command to stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Use the `git commit` command to commit the staged changes along with a meaningful message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message here"
     ```

6. **Push Changes to the Repository**:
   - Use the `git push` command to push your committed changes to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```
   - If it's your first time pushing to this repository, you might need to specify the remote and branch:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   Replace `master` with the branch name if you're pushing to a different branch.

7. **Enter Personal Access Token as Authentication**:
   - When prompted for credentials during the push, enter your username (usually your email) and use your personal access token as the password.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create a private Git repository, connect to it using Git Bash, and push your code changes securely using a personal access token for authentication.
